A/B testing (also known as split testing) is the process of comparing two versions of a web page, email, 
or other marketing asset and measuring the difference in performance. 
You do this giving one version to one group and the other version to another group. 
Then you can see how each variation performs


Pros of A/B testing
a. Get clear evidence
   It’s easy to see how many users complete a transaction with site A over site B. 
   The evidence is based on real behaviour, so is hard data of the type that money men love (and can be presented in a simple-looking, hard hitting chart).
b. Test new ideas
   If you have an innovative idea for an existing site, A/B testing provides hard proof as to whether it works or not. 
   However, you will need to implement that big idea in hard code before you can test it this way.
c. Optimise one step at a time
   If you run a large site, or many sites, then A/B testing is a fantastic opportunity to “patch” test, 
   by starting out in a small corner and then working up to the main pages of the site. 
d. Answer specific design questions
   Are green buttons better than red ones for your site design? 
   This and many other questions can be answered by A/B testing as they allow the designer to test different colours, 
   placement of buttons, page layouts, different images which are all good areas to slowly improve a website.
   
   
Cons of A/B testing
a. Can take lots of time and resources

b. Only works for specific goals

c. Doesn’t improve a dud

d. Could end up with constant testing
   Once the test is over, that is it. The data is useless for anything else. 
   Further A/B tests will have to start from a new baseline and other types of testing will only likely be applied to the more successful site, 
   when they could have found equally useful information from the rejected version.
